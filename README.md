Turn your Android device into a **versatile wireless audio transmitter, receiver, or web server**.  
This application allows you to send your phone's audio to any device on the local network (PC, browser, media player), or listen to audio from another device, all without root.

## ✨ Key Features  

* **Multi-Protocol Architecture**: Stream using the native low-latency protocol (WFAS), standard **RTP** for external media players, or **HTTP** to listen directly from any web browser (Chrome, Safari, Smart TVs).
* **Smart Auto-Connect**: The app can automatically connect to prioritized IP addresses as soon as they are detected on the network, even in the background.
* **Widgets & Quick Settings**: Control your server or client directly from your home screen using Material You widgets, or use the Quick Settings tiles in your notification shade for instant access.
* **Internal Audio Streaming**: Stream your device's internal audio (apps, games, music) to other devices (requires Android 10+).  
* **Automatic & Smart Manual Discovery**: Clients automatically find available servers on the local network. If entering an IP manually, the app automatically detects if the host is using Unicast or Multicast.
* **Network Interface Selection**: Manually select your active network interface to bypass VPN routing issues or handle multiple Wi-Fi/LAN connections.
* **Server Volume Control**: Adjust the transmission volume directly from the UI or by using your device's physical volume buttons while streaming.
* **Microphone Sharing**: Stream your microphone to the server, with a dedicated mute button to silence it mid-session without disconnecting.
* **Connection Sounds**: The app plays a sound on connect and disconnect, so you always know what's happening. Both are toggleable in settings.
* **Modern Interface**: Built with **Jetpack Compose** and **Material Expressive**, featuring dynamic colors and bilingual support (EN/IT).

## 📡 Protocol Guide

Choose the best streaming protocol for your needs:

* **WFAS (Native)**: Best for minimal latency and strict synchronization. Requires the app installed on both the sender and receiver. Ideal for gaming and watching videos.
* **RTP**: The industry standard for external media players. Generates an `.sdp` file that can be opened with VLC, Kodi, or FFplay.
* **HTTP (Web)**: Maximum compatibility using high-efficiency hardware AAC encoding. Listen from any device with a browser. *(Note: Browsers enforce internal buffering, introducing a standard 1–3 second delay).*

## 🚀 Quick Start  

### Required Permissions  
* **Screen Capture (for Internal Audio)**: To stream internal audio, Android requires starting a temporary "screen capture" session. Only audio is recorded, no images.  
* **Notifications**: A persistent notification keeps the streaming service active and stable in the background.  
* **Audio (Optional)**: `RECORD_AUDIO` is only requested if you enable microphone sharing in the settings.

### Sending Audio (Server Mode)  
1. Launch the app and select **Send (Server)**.  
2. In **Audio Source**, enable **Internal Audio**.  
3. Choose your preferred protocol in the settings (WFAS, RTP, or HTTP Web).
4. For WFAS/RTP, choose **Multicast** (multiple clients) or **Unicast** (single client).  
5. Tap **Start Server**.  

---

### Receiving Audio (Client Mode)  
1. Launch the app and select **Receive (Client)**.  
2. The app will automatically search for active servers on the network.  
3. Select a server from the list to connect.  
4. **Fallback (Manual IP)**: If your router blocks discovery, type the server's IP address into the manual input field. The app will automatically configure the correct connection mode.
